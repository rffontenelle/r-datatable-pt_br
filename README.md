# r-datatable-pt_br

*This was a temporary storage and CI solution to coordinate the initial Brazilian Portuguese translation for data.table. This contribution landed data.table's source code, so this repository is now archived.*

- Translation takes place in Transifex:  
https://app.transifex.com/rafaelff1/r-datatable-pt_br/dashboard/

- Translations are synced with GitHub via Transifex integration in (restricted access):
