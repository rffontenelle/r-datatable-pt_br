"The data_table.%s version (%s) does not match the package (%s). Please close "
"all R sessions to release the old %s and reinstall data.table in a fresh R "
"session. The root cause is that R's package installer can in some "
"unconfirmed circumstances leave a package in a state that is apparently "
"functional but where new R code is calling old C code silently: https://bugs."
"r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17478. Once a package is in this "
"mismatch state it may produce wrong results silently until you next upgrade "
"the package. Please help by adding precise circumstances to 17478 to move "
"the status to confirmed. This mismatch between R and C code can happen with "
"any package not just data.table. It is just that data.table has added this "
"check."
